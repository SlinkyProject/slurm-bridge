## Overview

In Kubernetes, scheduling refers to making sure that pods are matched to nodes
so that the kubelet can run them.

The scheduler controller in `slurm-bridge` is responsible for [scheduling]
eligible pods onto nodes that are managed by `slurm-bridge`. In doing so, the
`slurm-bridge` scheduler interacts with the Slurm REST API in order to acquire
allocations for its' workloads. In `slurm-bridge`, `slurmctld` serves as the
source of truth for scheduling decisions.

## Design

This scheduler is designed to be a non-primary scheduler (e.g. should not
replace the default [kube-scheduler]). This means that only certain pods should
be scheduled via this scheduler (e.g. non-critical pods).

This scheduler represents Kubernetes Pods as a Slurm Job, waits for Slurm to
schedule the Job, then informs Kubernetes on which nodes to allocate the
represented Pods. This scheduler defers scheduling decisions to Slurm, hence
certain assumptions about the environment must be met for this to function
correctly.

      note over SBS: Translate Pod(s) into Slurm Job

      SAPI-->>SBS: Return Submit Status
    option Job is Pending
      note over SBS: Check again later...
      SBS->>SBS: Requeue
    option Job is Allocated
      note over SBS: Bind Pod(s) to Node(s) from the Slurm Job
      SBS->>KAPI: Bind Pod(s) to Node(s)
      KAPI-->>SBS: Return Bind Request Status
    end %% Lookup Slurm Placeholder Job
  end %% loop Scheduling Loop
