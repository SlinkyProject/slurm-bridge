## Overview

[The Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/)
defines admission controllers as:

> a piece of code that intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server prior to
> persistence of the resource, but after the request is authenticated and
> authorized.

It also states that:

> Admission control mechanisms may be validating, mutating, or both. Mutating
> controllers may modify the data for the resource being modified; validating
> controllers may not.

The `slurm-bridge` admission controller is both mutating and validating. It
modifies pods within namespaces specified in `helm/slurm-bridge/values.yaml` to
use the `slurm-bridge` [scheduler] instead of the default Kubernetes scheduler,
and rejects unsupported resource combinations.

## Design

Any pods created in the specified namespaces will have their
`.spec. schedulerName` changed to the slurm-bridge [scheduler].

Managed namespaces are defined as a list of namespace as configured in the
admission controller's `values.yaml` for `managedNamespaces[]`. Alternatively, a
`managedNamespaceSelector` can be used to select namespaces based on labels. If
`managedNamespaceSelector` is set, `managedNamespaces` will be ignored.

Managed pods can request either native `cpu` or the CPU DRA extended resource
`deviceclass.resource.kubernetes.io/dra.cpu`, but cannot specify both. CPU DRA
must be requested explicitly; native `cpu` requests are not converted to DRA
requests by the admission controller.
