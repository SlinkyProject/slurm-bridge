## Overview

[Slurm] and [Kubernetes] are workload managers originally designed for different
kinds of workloads. Kubernetes excels at scheduling workloads that run for an
indefinite amount of time, with potentially vague resource requirements, on a
single node, with loose policy, but can scale its resource pool infinitely to
meet demand; Slurm excels at quickly scheduling workloads that run for a finite
amount of time, with well-defined resource requirements and topology, on
multiple nodes, with strict policy, and a known resource pool.

This project enables the best of both workload managers. It contains a
[Kubernetes] scheduler to manage select workloads from Kubernetes, which allows
for co-location of Kubernetes and Slurm workloads within the same cluster. This
means the same hardware can be used to run both traditional HPC and cloud-like
workloads, reducing operating costs.

Using `slurm-bridge`, workloads can be submitted from within a Kubernetes
context as a `Pod`, `PodGroup`, `Job`, `JobSet`, or `LeaderWorkerSet` and from a
Slurm context using `salloc` or `sbatch`. Workloads submitted via Slurm will
execute as they would in a Slurm-only environment, using `slurmd`. Workloads
submitted from Kubernetes will have their resource requirements translated into
a representative Slurm job by `slurm-bridge`. That job will serve as a
placeholder and will be scheduled by the Slurm controller. Upon resource
allocation to a K8s workload by the Slurm controller, `slurm-bridge` will bind
the workload's pod(s) to the allocated node(s). At that point, the kubelet will
launch and run the pod the same as it would within a standard Kubernetes
instance

## Features

### Slurm

Slurm is a full featured HPC workload manager. To highlight a few features:

- [**Priority**][slurm-priority]: assigns priorities to jobs upon submission and
  on an ongoing basis (e.g. as they age).
- [**Preemption**][slurm-preempt]: stop one or more low-priority jobs to let a
  high-priority job run.
- [**QoS**][slurm-qos]: sets of policies affecting scheduling priority,
  preemption, and resource limits.
- [**Fairshare**][slurm-fairshare]: distribute resources equitably among users
  and accounts based on historical usage.

## Compatibility

| Software   |                             Minimum Version                              |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Kubernetes | [v1.29](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/12/13/kubernetes-v1-29-release/) |
| Slurm      | [25.05](https://www.schedmd.com/slurm-version-25-05-0-is-now-available/) |

## Limitations

- Exclusive, whole node allocations are made for each pod.

## Installation

Create a secret for slurm-bridge to communicate with Slurm.

```sh
export SLURM_JWT=$(scontrol token username=slurm lifespan=infinite)
kubectl create namespace slurm-bridge
kubectl create secret generic slurm-bridge-jwt-token --namespace=slinky --from-literal="auth-token=$SLURM_JWT" --type=Opaque
```

Install the slurm-bridge scheduler:

```sh
helm install slurm-bridge oci://ghcr.io/slinkyproject/charts/slurm-bridge \
  --namespace=slinky --create-namespace
```

For additional instructions, see the [quickstart] guide.
